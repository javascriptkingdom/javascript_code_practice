# Objective
The objective of this assignment is to reinforce your understanding of various types of operators in JavaScript, including arithmetic operators, remainder operator, assignment operators, unary operators, and comparison operators.

## Instructions

1. **Arithmetic Operators**
    - Write a JavaScript program that takes two numbers as input and performs the following arithmetic operations:
        - Addition
        - Subtraction
        - Multiplication
        - Division

2. **Remainder Operator**
    - Extend the program to include the calculation of the remainder when one number is divided by another.

3. **Assignment Operators**
    - Create a variable and assign it an initial value.
    - Use assignment operators to perform the following operations and display the result:
        - Increment the variable by a specific value.
        - Decrement the variable by a specific value.
        - Multiply the variable by a specific value.
        - Divide the variable by a specific value.

4. **Unary Operators**
    - Implement a section in your program to demonstrate the use of unary operators.
        - Use the unary plus operator to convert a string to a number.
        - Use the unary minus operator to negate a numeric value.
        - Use the logical NOT operator to invert a boolean value.

5. **Comparison Operators**
    - Write a program that compares two numbers and prints the following comparisons:
        - Equal to
        - Not equal to
        - Greater than
        - Less than
        - Greater than or equal to
        - Less than or equal to
        
## Submission
Submit your JavaScript code as a single file or provide a link to an online code repository (e.g., GitHub). Ensure that your code is well-commented and organized.
