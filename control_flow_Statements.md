# JavaScript Control Flow Statements Assignment

## Objective
The objective of this assignment is to enhance your understanding of control flow statements in JavaScript, including `if`, `else if`, `switch` case, nested `if else`, Ternary operators, `while`, `do while`, `for` loop, `break`, and `continue`.

## Instructions

### 1. **`if`, `else if`, `else` Statements**
   - Write a JavaScript program that uses `if`, `else if`, and `else` statements to:
     - Determine if a given number is positive, negative, or zero.
     - Classify a person's age into categories such as "Child," "Teenager," "Adult," or "Senior."

### 2. **`switch` Case**
   - Extend the program to utilize a `switch` case for:
     - Assigning the day of the week based on a given number (1-7).
     - Identifying the type of fruit based on a provided fruit name.

### 3. **Nested `if else` Statements**
   - Create a program with nested `if else` statements to:
     - Determine eligibility for voting based on age and citizenship.
     - Categorize a person's BMI (Body Mass Index) as "Underweight," "Normal weight," "Overweight," or "Obese."

### 4. **Ternary Operators**
   - Implement a section in your program using Ternary operators to:
     - Check if a given number is even or odd.
     - Determine whether a person is eligible for a discount based on their membership status.

### 5. **`while` and `do while` Loops**
   - Write programs utilizing `while` and `do while` loops to:
     - Display numbers from 1 to 10 in reverse order.
     - Calculate the factorial of a given number.

### 6. **`for` Loop, `break`, and `continue` Statements**
   - Create a program using a `for` loop and demonstrate the use of `break` and `continue` to:
     - Find prime numbers within a specified range.
     - Display the multiplication table of a given number, skipping multiplication by 3.

## Submission
Submit your JavaScript code as a single file or provide a link to an online code repository (e.g., GitHub). Ensure that your code is well-commented, organized, and includes explanations where necessary to clarify the logic used for each task.
